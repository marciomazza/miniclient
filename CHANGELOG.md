## [0.0.1]

Initial release.

- A Python `Browser` that drives real htmx behavior by running htmx and happy-dom
  inside a `jsrun` (V8) JavaScript runtime, with `fetch` bridged through `httpx`.
- DOM interaction (load, query, click, submit, dispatch events) via JS evaluated
  in the runtime.
- happy-dom patched/polyfilled to fix divergences from real browser behavior.
